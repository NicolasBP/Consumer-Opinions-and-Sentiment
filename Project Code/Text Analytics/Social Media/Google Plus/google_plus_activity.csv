I&#39;d thought I&#39;d explain why I&#39;m happy with it. This is specifically about the drinkable version, Soylent 2.0<br /><br />* It&#39;s cheap: when you break it down, Soylent is $3.00 a bottle, and each bottle lasts me more than one meal. If I have half in the morning, I will have half when I get back home after work.<br /><br />* It&#39;s healthier: usually when you open your fridge when you&#39;re hungry you&#39;re going to get what&#39;s in front of you, which is almost never as nutritional as what a bottle of Soylent offers. Sure, there are good healthy meals to have, but how many of these do you have ready on standby?<br /><br />* No Dishes: I used to do dishes every morning and often in the evening. With Soylent, suddenly that&#39;s barely a thing. I wash my coffee mugs and one plate, here and there, barely.<br /><br />* Saves you time in the morning: The mornings are filled with stuff to do. From writing in my journal to meditation to a quick shower, there&#39;s just not enough time. As a result, I used to almost never bother with breakfast and eat at work. Now I just grab a bottle as I do something else and I&#39;m fine.<br /><br />* Saves you from cooking: Yes, cooking can be nice, sometimes. When you have the time to put into it, you know what you&#39;re doing, and you have the right ingredients. 7 times out of 10, this is not the case for me. If I<i> really</i>feel like cooking some pasta or salad. Again, time saved.<br /><br />* It&#39;s nice and cool: in the morning, and actually helps you to cool down.<br /><br />* You enjoy food more: Soylent is not meant to replace<i> all</i>the food,<i> all</i>the time. So when I want to go out and eat with someone, I enjoy the food even more, because it&#39;s really special. Not to mention, I have more money to spend on that.<br /><br />* Vegan: there are no animals used in any way creating this thing. For me, it&#39;s not really a problem in general, but it&#39;s still nice to know.<br /><br />* Less smelly trash: you can flatten each bottle with steam and cold water and it takes almost no space. It also doesn&#39;t smell. It&#39;s also recyclable.<br /><br />* More room in the fridge, less expiration dates to worry about: I used to throw away fruits and vegetables I didn&#39;t eat, and worry about expression date of cheese and dairy.  The bottles come in a tight box which is easy to store and takes less space.<br /><br />I&#39;m very happy with Soylent so far, and I changed my subscription to a &quot;serious&quot; quantity which will last me a whole month at once this time. I was considering to powdered version but decided not to do that at the end because the bottles are just much more comfortable, and not that much more expensive.<br /><br />\ufeff","Soylent is a nutritionally complete, ready-to-drink, meal in a bottle; a simple solution to the substantial amount of time and money most people spend maintaining healthy diets for less than $2.50 a meal.",soylent

The taste is like a moderately strong coffee mixed with 2.0. I love my coffee black, so I really like the taste, but if you add a lot of cream and sugar to your coffee, it may be slightly bitter to you. It also has a hint of chocolate flavor due to a small amount of cocoa powder.<br /><br />Caffeine and coffee replacement potential: one bottle has 175mg of caffeine which I think is comparable to a large Starbucks coffee (yes, large, not vendegrande or whatever they call it). That&#39;s more than I&#39;m used to but I didn&#39;t have any issues, likely due to an herb additive usually found in tea leaves that is widely believed to help you feel calm and relaxed. Speaking of herbs, Coffiest had a surprising &quot;asparagus-effect&quot; on me, although completely different smell. Not sure if that lasts long-term though.<br /><br />Overall: I&#39;m extremely happy with Coffiest and am really looking forward to not having to make coffee every morning. Just like your jaw has to adjust to not chewing as much when you start on Soylent, I think I&#39;ll have to psychologically adjust to not drinking coffee. I&#39;ll admit - this morning felt weird without it. I also think I&#39;ll end up mixing a bottle of regular 2.0 and a bottle of Coffiest and having that for breakfast and lunch, instead of Coffiest for breakfast and 2.0 for lunch.<br /><br />Bottom line: I think Rosa Labs has hit a grandslam with Coffiest.

So I ordered a refill, this time banana flavour, and I also thought I&#39;d try out their main competitor in Europe which is Queal. Queal costs \u20ac10 more for the powder, but \u20ac8 less for the P&amp;P to Ireland so the price actually came out almost the same. I got the Apple flavour (sadly artificial, unlike Joylent&#39;s all natural flavourings), and Queal has a less sophisticated formula to Joylent or Soylent still requiring an oil bottle and using a generic vitamin powder, so you get too much of some of the vitamins and minerals. You also get too much protein because instead of flaxseed they just have extra oat flour, soy flour and whey which I assume eases manufacturing. Interestingly, they are also based in Amsterdam.<br /><br />Joylent is clearly the biggest player in Europe as you can see by the size of their new warehouse (<a href=""http://joylent-blog.tumblr.com/post/117244686720/almost-a-year-of-joylent"" class=""ot-anchor""> http://joylent-blog.tumblr.com/post/117244686720/almost-a-year-of-joylent</a>) and the fact they are selling 30 metric tonnes of product per month now (Soylent in the US probably ship about twice that), and I am finding the popularity of powdered meals in Europe surprising. Put another way, Europeans didn&#39;t invent the idea and took a year longer to pick it up over the Americans, but now we&#39;re going we have much more competition here and it looks like more rapid growth too in aggregate as an industry. For a continent which is<i> very</i>fussy about its food, where it came from, what&#39;s in it (no GMOs!) and so on, you&#39;d have thought powdered meals anathema here. Also, to be blunt, the quality of average food in Europe (not Ireland nor the UK) is way higher than in the US where quantity is definitely favoured over quality, so you&#39;d have thought there less pressure to eat differently. Additionally we pay a good 60% more for our food than the Americans too, and the combination of those two explains much of the lack of obesity, diabetes and other food related illnesses.<br /><br />Moreover, Joylent/Queal is not cheaper than normal food. It costs me \u20ac3.50/day, for which I can easily make a premium sandwich - nay,<i> two</i>premium sandwiches and have change left over. So even on that measure powdered meals should not be as popular as they are here.<br /><br />I suspect the main wins are convenience (no preparation), calorie control (hard to control sandwich contents, always easy to add an extra splash of mayonnaise) and possibly that you do feel really good on powdered meals - lots of energy, regular bowel movements, mind feels active and quick. I also suspect for many people that they aren&#39;t comparing the price to DIY sandwiches, but to store bought ones and/or to eating out for lunch every day and/or fast food, and on that measure \u20ac3.50/day does indeed look cheap.<br /><br />And also, ultimately, because Europeans are hypocrites about their food, and love to do in private what they disparage publicly. Which nation eats more McDonalds per head than any other? France. Yet you wouldn&#39;t know it talking to a French person!<br /><br /><a rel=""nofollow"" class=""ot-hashtag"" href=""https://plus.google.com/s/%23joylent""> #joylent</a>\xa0<a rel=""nofollow"" class=""ot-hashtag"" href=""https://plus.google.com/s/%23queal""> #queal</a>\xa0<a rel=""nofollow"" class=""ot-hashtag"" href=""https://plus.google.com/s/%23soylent""> #soylent</a>\xa0\ufeff","Quick delivery \u2013 \u20ac2,- per meal or less \u2013 100% of RDA \u2013 Shipping in Europe \u2013 Vegetarian Queal is a healthy and complete shake \u2013 Buy it now",joylent

The main difference was adding an egg - this helped bind the Joylent together, and made it much more robust in the pan. The &#39;stuff&#39; of Joylent sticks to the non-stick more than regular pancake batter, so a jiggle of the pan is not enough to release the pancake intact; it requires a spatula under it. Since it is still a bit fragile, I kept the size down, and this helped a lot.<br /><br />The full recipe I used:<br />1/4 bag Joylent<br />1/4 pint milk<br />1 egg.<br />A dab of butter in the pan for each pancake.<br /><br />As for taste - I would be hard pressed to tell these are not just very tasty pancakes. They could easily be mixed with other stuff, savoury or sweet. With pancakes conquered, I will have to try the brownie recipe I have seen online...\ufeff",,joylent

H\xe9 oui, pour manger de la nourriture scientifique, il faut faire des calculs !<b> N\u2019h\xe9sitez pas \xe0 augmenter les doses</b>et \xe0 consid\xe9rer qu\u2019un sachet vous fera 2 repas et pas 3 comme annonc\xe9.<br /><br />\u2013 Attention, si vous augmentez les doses, le shaker sera peut-\xeatre<b> trop petit,</b>il vous faudra vous en pr\xe9parer un autre, ou remanger un peu plus tard dans la journ\xe9e \u2013 c\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs pour \xe7a que certaines poudres (comme<a rel=""nofollow"" class=""ot-hashtag"" href=""https://plus.google.com/s/%23Huel""> #Huel</a>) sont pr\xe9vues pour<b> 4 voire 5 prises dans la journ\xe9e.</b>Une fois de plus, faites comme vous pr\xe9f\xe9rez.<br /><br />\u2013 Les premi\xe8res d\xe9gustations peuvent \xeatre d\xe9routantes, ne vous attendez pas \xe0 de la grande cuisine ! Les fabricants font certes des efforts, mais globalement, on est quand m\xeame<b> plus proche d\u2019une bouillie ou p\xe2te \xe0 cr\xeapes \xe9paisse</b>que de la haute gastronomie.<br /><br />\u2013<b> Faites des essais,</b>ne restez pas sur une premi\xe8re impression qui pourrait \xeatre d\xe9sagr\xe9able. Si vous n\u2019avez pas aim\xe9, essayez de<b> jouer sur la dilution.</b>Certains aiment bien \xe9pais, d\u2019autres plus fluide :<b> la consistance joue vraiment sur le go\xfbt.</b>Mais attention, comme pour un Ricard noy\xe9, un chouia trop d\u2019eau, et la pr\xe9paration prend un go\xfbt aqueux gu\xe8re agr\xe9able.<br /><br />\u2013 Utilisez<b> une eau au go\xfbt de laquelle vous \xeates habitu\xe9s, ou de l&#39;eau du robinet.</b>Une eau au go\xfbt trop inhabituel, ou trop marqu\xe9, risque de donner un go\xfbt peu agr\xe9able \xe0 la pr\xe9paration (j&#39;ai eu le coup r\xe9cemment avec de la Wattwiller, que j&#39;ai utilis\xe9e par hasard, et qui m&#39;a donn\xe9 l&#39;impression que mon shake avait tourn\xe9, alors que c&#39;\xe9tait juste le go\xfbt marqu\xe9 de cette eau, que je ne connaissais pas).<br /><br />\u2013 Si vous \xeates chez vous et qu\u2019un peu de vaisselle ne vous fait pas peur, faites votre pr\xe9paration<b> au mixer ou blender \xe9lectrique,</b>le m\xe9lange sera parfait.<br /><br />\u2013 Si vous utilisez le<b> shaker,</b>en fonction de votre vigueur musculaire lors du secouage, les r\xe9sultats pourront varier, avec<b> plus ou moins de grumeaux.</b>Les m\xe9thodes de pr\xe9paration varient, faites comme vous pr\xe9f\xe9rez. La mienne : d\u2019abord la boule en fil de fer, puis la poudre, puis les \xbe de l\u2019eau, puis secouer assez fort pendant 30 secondes, ajouter l\u2019eau restante et secouer encore 30 secondes.<br /><br />\u2013 Attention \xe0 ceux qui disent qu\u2019il faut m\xe9langer avec de<b> l\u2019eau ti\xe8de ou chaude :</b>c\u2019\xe9tait peut-\xeatre valable pour les toutes premi\xe8res g\xe9n\xe9rations de poudres, mais les recettes actuelles sont maintenant bien au point et se m\xe9langent parfaitement. Et surtout, c\u2019est<b> dangereux :</b>la chaleur met le shaker sous pression et il risque de s\u2019ouvrir brusquement.<br /><br />\u2013 Si vous en avez la possibilit\xe9, laissez reposer votre pr\xe9paration<b> plusieurs heures au r\xe9frig\xe9rateur :</b>les fibres vont gonfler et la pr\xe9paration sera plus \xe9paisse, plus consistante. (Attention cependant aux poudres qui contiennent des<b> levures :</b>pass\xe9 6 heures, elles vont commencer leur fermentation naturelle, et votre pr\xe9paration va prendre un go\xfbt un peu aigre. Mais vous pouvez aimer, ce n\u2019est pas toxique, apr\xe8s tout, la bi\xe8re\u2026). N\u2019oubliez pas de re-secouer un coup en sortant du frigo.<br /><br />\u2013 Mais vous pouvez bien s\xfbr la pr\xe9f\xe9rer<b> consomm\xe9e imm\xe9diatement ;</b>\xe0 vous de tester et voir ce que vous pr\xe9f\xe9rez.<br /><br />\u2013 Avez-vous d\xe9j\xe0 mang\xe9 un steack-frites en 1 minutes ? Non ! Pareil pour le repas liquide : si vous le buvez trop vite, il va vous peser sur l\u2019estomac comme une brique.<b> Prenez donc votre temps</b>pour ing\xe9rer votre pr\xe9paration :<b> sirotez-la</b>en lisant, surfant ou en vous reposant sur un banc dans un parc. Vous devez la prendre en une vingtaine de minutes, comme un repas normal.<br /><br />\u2013 Et m\xeame,<b> m\xe2chouillez-la :</b>les graines ou les morceaux de fruits secs qu\u2019elle contient seront mieux dig\xe9r\xe9s, et la mastication aide \xe0 faire venir la<b> sensation de sati\xe9t\xe9.</b><br /><br />\u2013 Certains ont rapport\xe9 des<b> surprises gazeuses</b>en phase finale de digestion\u2026  C\u2019est normal, il y a une une p\xe9riode d\u2019adaptation \xe0 cette nouvelle nourriture tr\xe8s riche en fibre. Si vraiment \xe7a ne s\u2019arrange pas,<b> changez de poudre ou arr\xeatez tout.</b><br /><br />\u2013 A fortiori, ne passez pas un r\xe9gime 100% poudre du jour au lendemain,<b> allez-y progressivement.</b><br /><br />\u2013 Vous trouvez votre poudre un peu fade ?

Pourtant, j&#39;adh\xe8re \xe0 200% au concept - ne plus avoir \xe0 se pr\xe9occuper du tout de la nourriture. Mais on ignore tout des effets \xe0 long terme : m\xeame si \xe7a contient a priori tous les nutriments n\xe9cessaires, reste le probl\xe8me du format poudreux et de l&#39;absence compl\xe8te de vari\xe9t\xe9 (pas un probl\xe8me pour moi, mais mon organisme semble protester avec force). Notre syst\xe8me digestif a \xe9volu\xe9 pour s&#39;adapter \xe0 la nourriture solide (ou du moins &quot;p\xe2teuse&quot;, une fois m\xe2ch\xe9e et saliv\xe9e), il me semble difficile d&#39;affirmer qu&#39;un changement si radical serait sans cons\xe9quences.<br /><br />Bref, tu as gagn\xe9, Univers, je vais me r\xe9signer \xe0 g\xe2cher des milliers d&#39;heures de ma vie trop courte \xe0 &quot;manger sain&quot;... mais tu ne perds rien pour attendre !\ufeff",,huel shake

The description is slightly Different, because now the characters are seeing it from inside the influence of the singularity.<br /><br />While the Fate of the World is in the hands of the heroes, time pressure should not be so huge that the characters can&#39;t make side trips (such as to collect the pieces of Turnip Noggin). The adventure can be straightforward or it can have side trips.<br /><br /><b> Aside: Scale</b><br /><br />Once the characters are shrunk, they&#39;re on the same scale as the toys, and interact with them normally. The toys are in the 1&quot;\u201118&quot; range, with Army Man as one of the smallest and Raggedy Annabelle as one of the largest.<br /><br />Given the size variability, it&#39;s a great deal of trouble keeping track of the relative size or growth of each character. Instead, when dealing with the real world, use a +3 or -3 bonus. A toy hiding from a normal person has +3 to hide, but has no size bonuses when hiding from another toy.<br /><br />A Strength 3 character who has to move a chair has an effective Strength of 0 (less if it&#39;s an armchair).<br /><br />You could spend a lot of time fiddling with Growth and Shrinking to find the exact values, but +3 is good enough.<br /><br /><b> Arrival</b><br /><br />It is dark, and they are crowded together, with the Bag of Holding (which is now a sack about half an action figure&#39;s height) and the Magic Detector Bubble. There is light coming from a slit in the roof. When the characters climb out, they find that they are in the house.<br /><br />* If a character went into the house earlier and found the Nassar family, the assistant places the PCs in the living room.<br /><br />* If no one found the Nassar family, the assistant places the PCs in the playroom to be out of sight while the assistant calls an ambulance for the family.<br /><br />If the PCs need to get to the playroom (guided by the magic detector), they can use the time to get used to their new size. Along the way, you can add any of the following complications:<br /><br />* The Nassar family have a cat, who is used to strange goings-on. But a set of animate action figures certainly arouse its curiosity.<br /><br />* The door to the playroom is closed. How will they get in? Sheer strength might not be enough, if the door is latched.<br /><br />* If the Nassar family is being tended by ambulance attendants, the strange people in the house might well be a distraction, especially as they are not likely to understand that the little walking action figures are superheroes. (Or they might; this might be par for the course in your campaign.)<br /><br /><b> The Playroom</b><br /><br />The Playroom is both a play room and a junk room, where material is stored. Both of the children practice magic rituals in this room, which is why the whole house has a magic charge; sometimes they play here, and Powerboy works on his models here. The floor is painted concrete with scraps of mis-matched carpet. The walls are drywalled but not painted, and there is a support pole just off the center of the room. The room has one small high window, covered by venetian blinds that are stuck down and closed, and two doors.<br /><br />By the end of the sofa is the box that held donated toys. Another box is at the other end, upside down, to serve as a makeshift table.\xa0 Along one wall behind the sofa are some metal shelves with paint cans, two boxes of books, some free weights, some jigsaw pieces that are missing only a few pieces, and a discarded fish tank that still has materials in the bottom (gravel, a castle, and the pump and aerator).<br /><br />There is an old card table and a folding chair. There is a tall lamp.<br /><br />One door leads to the basement hall, and the other door contains a closet with the electrical panel and the water softener; there is a drain at the bottom, covered by a grid.<br /><br />Between the hall door and the sofa is an old electric frying pan with the non-stick coating mostly gone. Right now it contains Army Man and is surrounded by other toys; Army Man needs rescuing.<br /><br />The playroom is where Powerboy went to practice his rituals, so the room and its contents built up a magical charge even before the creation of the &quot;magical singularity.&quot; It&#39;s also where he stored his model-making equipment (which hides his magical gear).<br /><br />The lamp is on, whether it is plugged in or not. (The magical singularity has increased its &quot;lampness&quot; so that it shines whether it is plugged on or even has a bulb.)<br /><br />Looking in the direction of the sofa, they can see the toys surrounding the frying pan, using it like a makeshift corral, with the Army Man inside it.<br /><br /><i> The Magic Detector</i><br /><br />Once in the playroom, the magic detector indicates that the singularity is in the direction of the sofa. \xa0If players decide to go to the sofa instead of investigating Army Man&#39;s execution, that&#39;s their choice.\xa0 His screams might convince them otherwise. Also, Army Man is on the way to the sofa.<br /><br /><i> &quot;Just a Toy&quot; Quality</i><br /><br />Toys have &quot;Just a Toy&quot; quality. They can invoke them to stunt something like Anatomic Separation (from<i> Great Power</i>) or stuffed toys might stunt Resistance to Damage 1 or Regeneration (stuffing put back in). Do what&#39;s appropriate.<br /><br /><b> The Rescue</b><br /><br />The players have arrived in time to rescue Army Man, who has been sentenced to death by melting. The frying pan is surrounded by four copies of Mimic Mud (it currently has Army Man&#39;s Duplication), a bear (Hunter Price, and Kung Fu Grim. There are two copies of Army Man, and a shot from Kung Fu Grim makes the copy disappear. Now Army Man is alone, and has to keep moving to keep off the hot frying pan. PCs might notice a sticky thread of melted plastic stretching from his feet.<br /><br />Like the lamp, the frying pan is not plugged in, but the temperature knob changes the heat--it is the frying pan&#39;s Platonic nature that&#39;s being invoked.<br /><br />After the players win, Hunter Price transfers her consciousness back to her body and warns Toy Rex. Give the players a Determination point for this.<br /><br /><i> The Army Man&#39;s Sitrep</i><br /><br />Toy Rex has set up a &quot;kingdom&quot; out of a fort made from old cushions. He has two advisors, Raggedy Annabelle and Fair Bear. Raggedy Annabelle also serves as the small community&#39;s shaman, communing with the spirits. She is the only one who knows where the singularity is; she is the only one who communicates with it. Army Man cannot go to her himself, because he\u2019s been sentenced to death.<br /><br />A death sentence means something more than dismemberment or shooting. Toys taken apart by Toy Rex&#39;s teeth can still work their parts, so Raggedy Annabelle hit on this method of execution for plastic toys. (Stuffed toys are &quot;de-stuffed.&quot;)<br /><br />Army Man&#39;s crime was disobeying orders: he refused to kill his friend, Turnip Noggin, and managed to escape with Turnip Noggin&#39;s mouth, eyes, and two ears. Turnip Noggin&#39;s body was melted in the frypan, but he lives on as an oracular mouth, a pair of eyes, and an ear. All three have to be in one place to have a decent conversation with him.<br /><br />Army Man wants to retrieve the mouth, eyes, and ear of Turnip Noggin, and argues that the parts might be useful. Retrieving them will involve side trips: he has hidden the parts of Turnip Noggin in three different places. (Players will undoubtedly find inventive ways to use Mr. Turnip Noggin, such as keeping his mouth and ear nearby and his eyes elsewhere, so he functions as a kind of ESP or remote viewing. Let them.)<br /><br /><b> Who&#39;s Who</b><br /><br />Army Man will briefly list the toys who have come to life and make up this small world. The players have already met Mimic Mud, Hunter Price, and Kung Fu Grim; Army Man can give them a rundown on their powers.<br /><br />Besides the characters listed wayyy back when, there are the following who will probably not be involved in the story:<br />* The Bests of the Wild are a menagerie of stuffed creatures led by Fair Bear, and with Loopy Lion, Grumpy Goat, Happy Hippo, and Love Puppy. Army Man suspects they are harmless. After all, Fair Bear is all about fairness: giving everyone an equal shake.<br />* The Men of Action have staked out a small territory on the top shelf. These are action figures who resemble the PCs and other supers in the campaign area. They are relatively late &quot;wakers&quot; and keep to themselves, having successfully held off Toy Rex.<br />* The Transmogrifiers are a series of vehicles that turn into robot animals. There are a few &quot;true&quot; Transmogrifiers and a number that came as gifts with fast food children&#39;s meals. The &quot;true&quot; Transmogrifiers look down on the &quot;fast food&quot; Transmogrifiers.<br />* Darby and Jen are a pair of fashion models. They have no actual interest besides fashion. Both have the ability to have any specialty at the Master level by dressing the part. Slacker Darby is an expert at computer operations, for example; Doctor Jen has medicine. (The power is Ability Boost (Int) 6, Extra: Coordination, Extra: Strength, Extra: Prowess, Limit: Must wear clothes, Limit: Extra time.)<br />* Baby Doll is a giant baby doll. He is the oldest of the toys, with a cloth body but plastic limbs and a head. He follows Love Puppy around, wanting the feeling of being loved. Love Puppy often indulges him, but sometimes regards him as a nuisance.<br /><br />The Men of Action, the Transmogrifiers, Darby and Jen, and Baby Doll are unlikely to get involved (but players are unpredictable).<br /><br /><i> &quot;By the way, we&#39;re going to kill you&quot;</i><br /><br />If any toy other than Army Man learns the PCs\u2019 goal of imprisoning the singularity, they turn against the PCs. So far as they know, the magical elimination or imprisonment of the singularity will make them cease to be.<br /><br />Army Man is used to the idea of putting himself in harm&#39;s way for the greater good. He is not happy about the idea of dying, but he can understand the necessity. It doesn&#39;t hurt that his foes will also die.<br /><br /><b> Our Action Figures, Our Foes</b><br /><br />If the PCs decide to enlist the aid of the Men of Action, they get to face their duplicates. The duplicates do not want to get involved, but can be convinced to do so if they face their counterparts in a duel, or through some other means.<br /><br />This is a side trek, but it might mean that the PCs have such overwhelming numbers that they can easily win when the Bests of the Wild attack.<br /><br /><b> Sofa, So Good</b><br /><br />Based on either the Magic Detector or Army Man, the PCs head toward the sofa, possibly to meet with Toy Rex, Raggedy Annabelle, or because the Magic Detector says they should.<br /><br />This is when the Bests of the Wild attack, under orders of Toy Rex. Use one less opponent than the PCs, up until four. (If there are even more PCs, add Hunter Price as the eagle, if necessary.)<br /><br />Fair Bear has secretly ordered the Bests of the Wild to lose, so they don&#39;t use their Mind Control. (Army Man might notice this.)<br /><br /><b> For the GM: What&#39;s Going On?</b><br /><br />There are three groups involved against the players.<br /><br />* Toy Rex and his enforcers (Mimic Mud, Kung Fu Grim, and Hunter Price) want to maintain the status quo. Kung Fu Grim is the only one of them who might look for Qualities to exploit.<br /><br />* Fair Bear wants to possess the singularity in order to rule the playroom. (&quot;All toys are equal, but some are more equal than others.&quot;) The Bests of the Wild follow him. Fair Bear has guessed that the appearance of strange toys is about the singularity in some way. He has no idea of\xa0 how the singularity really works. All he knows is that he needs to control it in order to rule. His plan is to provide token resistance against the PCs, but lose, and let them lead him to the singularity, which he will claim at the last minute. He believes that the Fair Glare is more than the equal of any one character, and he will be on the lookout for any Qualities of the PCs that he can exploit. (Just to be clear: he already<i> knows</i>where the singularity is. He doesn&#39;t want the PCs to take it away, so he won&#39;t tell them. What he wants is for Raggedy Annabelle to put it<i> in</i>something so that he can handle it. He knows that it can be done because of something she told him and Toy Rex in council&amp;mdash;she said she would do that if she had to move the singularity. Fair Bear is trying to create an emergency that will force her to merge it with an object for moving.)<br /><br />* Raggedy Annabelle communes with the singularity. She is the high priestess of this community, but she is the most nihilist of them all. Raggedy Annabelle has intuited the end result of the singularity&#39;s expansion, and she&#39;s fine with it. It will give her the revenge she wants. She&#39;ll be safe inside the manasphere. She is also the character who will tell everyone what will happen when the Bag of Holding is slipped over the singularity.<br /><br />Previously:<a href=""https://plus.google.com/109324107263188867598/posts/gKgKPDpurFK"" class=""ot-anchor""> https://plus.google.com/109324107263188867598/posts/gKgKPDpurFK</a><br /><br />Next:<a href=""https://plus.google.com/109324107263188867598/posts/27WXkwsPY2z"" class=""ot-anchor""> https://plus.google.com/109324107263188867598/posts/27WXkwsPY2z</a>\ufeff",,queal shake

Ca ne me d\xe9range pas en tant que tel, mais \xe7a semble indiquer que ce n&#39;est pas exactement tr\xe8s sain pour le syst\xe8me digestif (euph\xe9misme !).<br />- Mal de gorge chronique (surtout au r\xe9veil), sans doutte li\xe9 aux renvois et \xe0 la nature poudreuse.<br />- Plus ennuyeux (et je semble \xeatre la seule personne sur internet dans ce cas) : hypertension, douleur au niveau du coeur (surtout au moment de dormir) et naus\xe9e au r\xe9veil, comme si j&#39;avais pris une petite cuite la veille. C&#39;est sans doute li\xe9 \xe0 mon insuffisance cardiaque de naissance : si je bois du th\xe9 ou du caf\xe9 (m\xeame en faible quantit\xe9), ou si je reste appuy\xe9 quelques minutes sur un bras (comme ceci --&gt;<a href=""http://www.girls.fr/data/imgs/articles/love_124810106421543400.jpg"" class=""ot-anchor""> http://www.girls.fr/data/imgs/articles/love_124810106421543400.jpg</a>), j&#39;ai grosso modo les m\xeames sympt\xf4mes. C&#39;est peut-\xeatre li\xe9 \xe0 une des vitamines pr\xe9sentes dans le Joylent (et pas dans mon alimentation usuelle) ayant le m\xeame effets que la caf\xe9ine. Grosso modo, \xe7a me met dans le m\xeame \xe9tat que si je buvais 3 ou 4 caf\xe9s par jour.<br /><br />Pourtant, je consomme la poudre de mani\xe8re extr\xeamemement progressive : l&#39;\xe9quivalent d&#39;un repas divis\xe9 en 5 petits shakes, \xe0 raison d&#39;un par heure, pour faire le pont entre le d\xe9jeuner et le d\xeener. Et je les bois le plus lentement possible, en &quot;salivant&quot; bien chaque gorg\xe9e, etc... A c\xf4t\xe9, d&#39;autres personnes boivent la m\xeame quantit\xe9 &quot;cul sec&quot;, et n&#39;ont pas le moindre probl\xe8me de cet ordre. J&#39;en conclus que c&#39;est moi qui suis &quot;intol\xe9rant au soylent&quot;...<br /><br />Bref, comme je ne tiens pas non plus \xe0 \xeatre un &quot;early adopter&quot; de diab\xe8te, infarctus ou cancer de l&#39;estomac, je crois que je vais en rester l\xe0, \xe0 grand regret (je prends l&#39;avion dans 4 jours, et ne tiens pas \xe0 finir aux urgences la veille). J&#39;ai command\xe9 un pack de Queal (marque concurrente), j&#39;essayerai quand m\xeame pour voir. Pourtant, j&#39;adh\xe8re \xe0 200% au concept - ne plus avoir \xe0 se pr\xe9occuper du tout de la nourriture. Mais on ignore tout des effets \xe0 long terme : m\xeame si \xe7a contient a priori tous les nutriments n\xe9cessaires, reste le probl\xe8me du format poudreux et de l&#39;absence compl\xe8te de vari\xe9t\xe9 (pas un probl\xe8me pour moi, mais mon organisme semble protester avec force). Notre syst\xe8me digestif a \xe9volu\xe9 pour s&#39;adapter \xe0 la nourriture solide (ou du moins &quot;p\xe2teuse&quot;, une fois m\xe2ch\xe9e et saliv\xe9e), il me semble difficile d&#39;affirmer qu&#39;un changement si radical serait sans cons\xe9quences.<br /><br />Bref, tu as gagn\xe9, Univers, je vais me r\xe9signer \xe0 g\xe2cher des milliers d&#39;heures de ma vie trop courte \xe0 &quot;manger sain&quot;... mais tu ne perds rien pour attendre !\ufeff",,queal shake

We\u2019ve...,0,0,0,"How to Reduce Global Warming for Fun + Profit<br /><br />It\u2019s easy to get depressed about climate change. We\u2019ve made so little progress in reducing carbon-dioxide emissions that our previous goal \u2014 to limit the rise in global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius \u2014 is almost laughable.<br /><br />But what if companies could make money from carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas that\u2019s the main contributor to global warming?<br /><br />We\u2019re not actually so far off from turning emissions into commodities, it turns out. In the United States alone, a number of companies aim to convert waste carbon dioxide into chemicals that can be used to make products we buy every day: bleach, baking soda, car seats, diapers, even fuel. What\u2019s more, these companies aren\u2019t just green do-gooders. They\u2019re all on the verge of commercialization and aim squarely at making money. There\u2019s certainly potential: The market for jet fuel alone was $200 billion in 2010.<br /><br />\u201cThe world is moving toward carbon capture, and if they can do it while making money, they\u2019d much rather do it that way,\u201d says Stacy MacDiarmid, a spokeswoman for Skyonic, based in Austin, Texas.<br /><br />They\u2019re pond scum, basically, but they work a marvel.<br /><br />Skyonic sets up shop near carbon emitters, like power plants, and captures their emissions. It then combines them with salt, water and electricity to yield high-purity sodium bicarbonate, aka baking soda, as well as hydrochloric acid and bleach. The company will open its first commercial carbon-capture plant later this month and believes it will generate $50 million in annual revenue.<br /><br />Bedford, Massachusetts-based Joule is another one to watch. Its genetically engineered bacteria catalyze a chemical process that converts CO2, sunlight and water into fuel that cars can use. This all takes place in giant tanks where bacteria grow. They\u2019re pond scum, basically, but they work a marvel: They metabolize carbon dioxide and produce synthetic fuel as a byproduct.<br /><br />In other words, Joule\u2019s technology eliminates the middleman \u2014 the dinosaurs, for example, that have spent hundreds of millions of years underground, fossilizing into hydrocarbon-based substances \u2014 and radically condenses the fuel production process by starting at the end \u2014 with the CO2. \u201cWhat we are producing is really the same product that is being produced by the fuel industry today. We\u2019re just doing it in real time,\u201d says Tom Jensen, the company\u2019s head of corporate development.<br /><br />Joule\u2019s fuel could be used in combustion engines, which means, theoretically, you could drive green without an electric car. Kiss your Tesla justifications goodbye. And if everything goes right, Joule says, its fuel could be sold for roughly $50 a barrel, or $1.20 gallon.<br /><br />Transforming emissions into useful stuff could have huge implications \u2014 for both business and the environment.\xa0<br /><br />Of course, that\u2019s a big if. We\u2019re a long way from those sort of prices, and it\u2019s worth remembering that rosy projections are the hallmark of nascent industry. One industry adviser cautions that technological development is always risky and, even in the best-case scenario, still takes a long time. Joule, for instance, doesn\u2019t even expect its commercial facility to be up and running for another few years.<br /><br />And yet, even the cautious recognize the potential: Transforming emissions into useful stuff could have huge implications \u2014 for both business and the environment. It\u2019s definitely a giant step forward from carbon capture and sequestration, or \u201cCCS,\u201d which was state of the art for decades. CCS entails separating the carbon dioxide from emissions, liquefying it under high pressure, then burying it in a geological formation where it stays for millions of years. CCS gets rid of carbon, but it\u2019s awfully expensive, and there\u2019s no commercial incentive to do it.<br /><br />Which is why carbon utilization is so promising: It might actually make money while helping reduce carbon dioxide \u2014 and at very large scale, too, because fuel and chemicals are huge markets.<br /><br />So are polymers, the base material for things like plastic containers, paints, mattress foam, even disposable diapers. That\u2019s what Novomer, based in Waltham, Massachusetts, has its eye on. As currently constructed, polymers are terribly ungreen: The industry today uses an estimated 7 to 8 percent of extracted oil and gas.<br /><br />Novomer\u2019s technology cuts the need for these fossil fuel-based raw materials in half. With a proprietary catalyst, the company reacts carbon molecules from carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide waste with traditional chemical feedstocks. The waste gas replaces 50 percent of the petroleum-based (propylene or propylene oxide) feedstock, which is an excellent deal for Novomer: It figures it can buy waste CO2 from industrial gas makers (like those that supply to soda manufacturers) for $100 a ton. Propylene oxide costs about $2,000 per ton, says Peter Shepard, Novomer\u2019s chief business officer. \u201cSo it\u2019s 20 times less expensive,\u201d Shepard says.<br /><br />Founded in 2007, Novomer has two base polymer products, each sold in three formats: hot-melt adhesives (for autos, shoes, furniture, textiles); rigid insulating foam (used for insulating homes and buildings); and coatings (used for decoration and protection of metal, plastic and wood). The products were launched commercially in June, and the company has capacity at a plant in Houston to produce them. Novomer expects to be profitable in the next 24 months or so.<br /><br />Shepard acknowledges Novomer\u2019s work is but a small piece of the puzzle. \u201cRealistically, there\u2019s way more CO2 than our product can ever capture. But we\u2019re definitely a step in the right direction,\u201d he says.\ufeff",40883_454448773.jpg,joulefuel

Fix it by changing your attachment to certain exercises. If you\u2019ve been trying to drop those 15 pounds of fat since the day you entered the gym, you could be eating wrong and not doing enough work. If you think you\u2019ve been lifting right and eating correctly, but you are still weak, fat, or skinny, it\u2019s definitely time to change your approach. Everyone knows how important it is to eat, but if you\u2019ve been struggling with any of these, your approach needs to be much more specific. You need to ask yourself, have I been training intensely enough? Am I putting in enough calories to grow? Am I eating way too many calories, specifically from carbohydrates? How good is my workout program? It is important that you get a work out log and a diet log. Write down everything you eat and what you worked out. Set mini one to two week goals. By the end of the week, I want to gain two pounds, in two weeks I want to lose 2-4 pounds, in 2 weeks I want to increase my bench press by 5 pounds are all great examples of mini goals that are achievable. Write down any progress made. If no progress was made, then you know that changes need to be made.\ufeff<br />Read more (15 lines)<br /><br />6Chachou Fln&#39;s profile photo<br /><br />Chachou Fln13:04<br /><br /><br />\xa0<br />\xa0<br />En fran\xe7ais \ufeff<br />Translate<br />Add a comment...<br /><br />Isaias Garcia<br />Shared publicly \xa0- \xa01 Feb 2016<br />\xa0<br /><br /><a href=""http://youtu.be/lX0RcfFOOCc"" class=""ot-anchor""> http://youtu.be/lX0RcfFOOCc</a>\ufeff<br /><br />3 Gorilla-Inspired Exercises That Will Work Your Entire Body<br />1<br />Add a comment...<br /><br />Isaias Garcia<br />Shared publicly \xa0- \xa01 Feb 2016<br />\xa0<br /><a href=""http://youtu.be/sREg8GrkPio"" class=""ot-anchor""> http://youtu.be/sREg8GrkPio</a>\ufeff<br /><br />5 Reasons to Take Supplements (AND WHEN YOU NEVER SHOULD!)<br />1<br />Add a comment...<br /><br />Isaias Garcia<br />Shared publicly \xa0- \xa01 Feb 2016<br />\xa0<br /><br /",,

My son plays football and he uses the protein shakes before and after practice and games. We had used an older one, but when I seen this one I knew this would be better. I was right!! The shaker is very well made and does an excellent job of mixing the powder. There is a ball on inside along with a Web like piece that covers the opening, then the lid. I don&#39;t know exactly how it does what it does, but there are no chunks left in the drink after using this. Another plus is that you can drink it right from this instead of needing another cup.

With today society and people being extremely into finesses it\u2019s a no brainer that when someone sees a meal replacement as a candy bar or a drink that they are super intrigued by it. So many of us are pressured into looking like people on the magazines and so much pressure is placed on us if we don\u2019t go to the gym or diet correctly or even eat correctly. With that being said it is always a good thing when something comes out that an make the process of getting fit and in shape easier, such as these bars. The bad thing with these bars is that they are being recalled for making people sick. This Is a big thing because as I talked about in the Samsung ad once a company gets bad word in it, it is extremely hard to recover and go back to what it used to be. It does not matter if they fix the health bar and make it to where people do not get sick, people are going to have this thought of the company in their head that is not good. However, I do believe that if this company can make the bar healthy and not a harm o the body that it can have a great shot in todays market. I truly am excited to see if this company can make a rebound, because I would personally be a client of this health bar<br />\ufeff",Do meal replacement shakes and bars really work?
