0,theskeletonboi,"Pretty sad that people are angry at you because you are Vegan. It is a \nfantastic choice, those who eat meat are statistically known to live 10 \nyears or more shorter lives (And Vegans have a 45% lower chance to have a \nheart attack). I have been Vegetarian most of my life, I eat delicious food \nall the time here in California, I guess most people don't notice \nVegetarian food is available in nearly every store. When you head to \nWalmart look in the frozen sections for the vast amount of Vegetarian \nburger patties, chicken nuggets, bacon, sea food, and more. I suppose \nrestaurants depend more on location, a friend of mine who used to love \nmeat, turned Vegetarian a couple years back. He lives in New York, so there \naren't that many vegan/vegetarian restaurants. However, in California I can \neat a delicious vegan west-style BBQ bacon burger with a side of seasoned \nfries within 7 minutes of my location.\n\nLike others pointed out, YouTube is about the creators uploading whatever \nthey want.

I had this problem with soylent. Chew a stick of gum \nfor 15 minutes before you drink soylent and you won't feel so spaced out \nand skippy. Not chewing will also jack up your blood pressure to unhealthy \nlevels even though your not getting too much sodium. This is experience \ntalking.

0,paz,"Looks like the seeds in Jake are flaxseeds. The use of while seeds worries \nme. There's a high chance your body won't be getting anything from the \nseeds at all, because flaxseed needs to be ground for your body to be able \nto digest it. This means if you live on Jake alone you will most definitely \nstart to see signs of malnutrition, as you won't be getting your fats. The \nuse of ground flaxseed in Joylent, rather than flaxseed oil (like in \nQueal), is also interesting. I was under the impression that ground \nflaxseed needs to be refrigerated in order to not go rancid. I wonder why \nthis doesn't seem to apply to meal replacement mixes.\ufeff",2015-05-22T21:08:16.000Z,0,joylent,HkMRD8mZ6mU,Review: Queal vs Jake vs Joylent,,,

I've only tried Aussielent Vanilla, but have been \nhaving it happily for breakfast and lunch (1/3 packet per meal) for about \nthree months now. I prefer it quite a bit thicker than you - perhaps 2:1 \npowder to water. I've found a Nutribullet mixes it really well and the two \npieces are easy to rinse after and then hand-wash in the evening.\nIt's strange though, how the taste changes when it's pre-mixed. When left \nto go bad, it releases gas, smells bad, and tastes sour. It tends to head \nin this direction rather quickly; even when leaving it sealed in the fridge \nin the morning, it starts to taste a little funny by the evening. I tend to \nmix breakfast and lunch in the morning, and leave the latter portion in my \nbag until lunch, which works out fine.\ufeff",2016-04-18T15:00:25.000Z,0,joylent,j1RAqX_qhbQ,Joylent vs Aussielent Review,,,

Open a bag wide and put the top of the \nbag in to the top of the cup . Gently beat the the bag while you turn \naround the cup. All of the powder goes in of the cup. \n\nIf you like it very liquid drink it directly. If you leave it 5 minutes or \nso it is more thick. Still very drinkable but not so runny. \n\nA good point is that the cup is very easy to clean. The Jake food washes \naway very easy, also if you do not wash it directly after use.\n\nIf you compare the price of Jake with other similar products look very good \nat the real price per kcal. The definition of what ""a meal"" is can vary. \nAnd the price per meal is what is advertised. \n\nJake is easy to use and stays good for a year. I use it mostly because this \nway I know exactly how many calories I eat, what is important when you try \nto limited your intake.\ufeff",2016-06-30T19:12:23.000Z,0,jakefood,Lhn6VIfvJog,JakeFood.com Product review,,,

This is brought \nhome even more strongly with your reference to other brands such as Joylent \nthat are not vegan and so not an option for me and other vegans.\ufeff",2015-04-24T20:38:00.000Z,2,jakefood,djKUq4VFYhs,"JAKE SHAKE review #1 April, 2015",,,
0,benjiferrero,"Good review on these things.  Did you get it on offer?  Checking on the \nJake and Joylent websites tonight, Jake seems to be quite a bit more \nexpensive than Joylent.\nJake original: \u20ac64.00+free shipping for 20 meals / \u20ac3.20 per meal.\nJake light: \u20ac59.00+free shipping for 20 meal / \u20ac2.95 per meal.\nJoylent: \u20ac30+\u20ac5 shipping for 15 meals / \u20ac2.33 per meal.\nI'm looking to try one of these shakes, but when is someone going to use \nsomething instead of the artificial sweetener sucralose (E955) in these \npowders? It seems that Soylent, Joylent and Jake all contain this. I can't \nstomach that stuff. I would prefer to add my own choice of sweetener \nafterwards (if at all).  Looking on the ingredients Jake has dextrose \n(D-Glucose) in it already, so why add an artificial sweetener too?  They \nshould include a sachet of sweetener if they must include it then the \ncustomer could adjust to their own personal tastes and preferences.\ufeff",2015-04-21T22:23:56.000Z,0,jakefood,djKUq4VFYhs,"JAKE SHAKE review #1 April, 2015",,,

0,paz,"Looks like the seeds in Jake are flaxseeds. The use of while seeds worries \nme. There's a high chance your body won't be getting anything from the \nseeds at all, because flaxseed needs to be ground for your body to be able \nto digest it. This means if you live on Jake alone you will most definitely \nstart to see signs of malnutrition, as you won't be getting your fats. The \nuse of ground flaxseed in Joylent, rather than flaxseed oil (like in \nQueal), is also interesting. I was under the impression that ground \nflaxseed needs to be refrigerated in order to not go rancid. I wonder why \nthis doesn't seem to apply to meal replacement mixes.\ufeff",2015-05-22T21:08:16.000Z,0,jakefood,HkMRD8mZ6mU,Review: Queal vs Jake vs Joylent,,,

I haven't tried Jake \nyet, but after watching this review I probably never will. Also because I'm \nso content with Joylent.

0,Chris Califano,"Hi Michelle! You ABSOLUTELY CAN eat large significant calorie meals of \nfruit/ smoothies BUT only if you say bye-bye to the high density carbs such \nas rice etc. Each of the three major leap-levels of physical performance \nand health, in relation to significant fuel modifications to the diet \nrequire a transition period. Those who eat rice, for example, AND eat large \namounts of fruit/ smoothies are going to have problems. The high density \ncarbs act like fats in interfering with digestion, assimilation and blood \nsugar efficiency. Eating rice for dinner and then having a fruit smoothie \nfor breakfast is a bad mix, as those who ""want their cake and eat it too"" \nwill surely discover. There are other metabolic-affecting factors such as \ntime on diet, intensity of regular activity, etc., but suffice it to say \nthat you can't mix low density carbs with high density carbs as a \nsignificant fuel source and expect even marginal health or performance.\ufeff",2016-08-06T13:10:41.000Z,1,meal replacement smoothie -supplement -bar -shake -prank,bklNfZ2xPsg,"Why I've Changed My Opinions About Fruit Smoothies being good for Weight loss, Diabetics and Health",,,

0,Enoch Abraham,"For folks having a hard time, I get where you are coming from. It is quite \na bit of stuff, and I personally would say it isn't necessary, nor would I \nadd all the superfoods. In fact, I stopped using superfoods period, because \nthey honestly feel overrated to me. However, this comes from personal \nexperience, which is the first teacher on this road you are taking. \nAlthough I do much better with self-grown simple microgreens and pressed \nsprout oils, I cannot knock what Cassar does. He also has massive amounts \nof money to invest in all this stuff, so it probably is going to need some \nadaptation by almost everyone who watches it. His fruits and vegetables are \ncoming from a Hawaiian farm he owns; I can barely even find organic \nwatermelon in Chicago, let alone an affordable one. But I have watched a \ngreat deal of Cassar stuff, and that has helped greatly with spurning the \nideas to get what I need despite the limits, which is why I am now eating \nalmost completely self made oils and greens. This is mainly a journey we \nlearn to take as we go along, not many are going to be able to map that out \neven remotely as well as we can for ourselves. So I appreciate this video, \neven though I personally wouldn't advocate most of these drink constituents \nas necessary, plausible, or efficient hehe.\ufeff",2013-11-22T09:54:47.000Z,2,meal replacement smoothie -supplement -bar -shake -prank,A5aHh2VHYsM,Dr Robert Cassar shows you Exotic Watermelon Detox Vitality Meal Smoothie,,,

They used to say not to \nmix vegetables and fruits in the same meal too. Is all that wrong now? I \nknow you said that there are a lot of enzymes in this, but all that in one \nmeal gives me a stomach ache just looking at it.  Isn't this one just a bit \nover the top and too complex?

0,John Smith,"My opinion is to use supplements for short periods of time, for a \nspecifically selected goal, and not as total replacement of meals. Making \nyour own shakes out of normal food is probably less risky than processed \nones, though. \n\n1) Almost everyone who isn't going hungry, elderly, or disabled in the US \nhas adequate minimum nutrition, even if the PROPORTIONs of nutrients are \nskewed to carbs and fats. A multivitamin is usually enough, if an \nindividual is concerned about missing a mineral or something in their diet.\n\n2) Meal supplements are not replacements. Even the well known product \nEnsure that is used in many hospitals is intended to be a supplement, or a \nlimited-time replacement. This is because we don't have the technology to \nexactly replicate everything from natural food.\n\n3) Manufactured supplements are not well regulated or certified. The FDA is \nnot required to check every dietary supplement unless the manufacturer \nmakes a specific health claim. Sometimes consumer advocates test the \nsupplements and find that the ingredients label is inaccurate. The \nmanufacturing process also sometimes concentrates naturally occurring \ntoxins, such as the arsenic and cadmium in whey protein that is marketed to \nathletes.\ufeff",2015-09-21T02:39:39.000Z,2,meal replacement review -smoothie -supplement -bar -shake -prank,PAepSdPa-c0,DIY Soylent Experiment,,,

0,Miguel Itriago,"So many comments saying it works and some saying it's a scam. Others saying \n""ugh"" just another coach"". First of all, a beachbody coach is someone who's \nused beachbody products and because they get results using their products \nthey share what they're doing with people who they think can benefit from \nit. That's all they are. Now there is a business opportunity and there are \nsome people who treat it like a pure sales business but the truth is it's \njust people sharing what worked for them. As for shakeology, the shake for \nme i've felt a difference one month using it and one month without it. \nHOWEVER it's up to the buyer if they want to get the shake or not. If you \ndo a workout program you don't need the shake to get results but it can add \nto your results if you take it. The price may seem a little high but it \nbalances out to about $4-5 per serving. If you can replicate the \ningredients in the shake great! There is no single path to following a \nhealthy lifestyle there are simply different ways to get different results. \nif some of you think it's a scam. If you believe you can create a different \nshake or suppliment that can help others at a cheaper price then do it! \nit's about helping people lead healthier fulfilling lives. It shouldn't be \na competition with ""hey what I do is better than what you do"" If you don't \nwant the shake don't get it. If you do want to try it my advice is to go by \nyour opinion with how you feel it has a bottom of the bag money back \nguarantee meaning if you take the entire month of shakeology and still \ndon't like it mail it back! no problem but don't attack and label EVERY \nBeachbody coach as some sort of scamming, selfish salesman because there \nare people who've gotten great results through Beachbody and want to share \nthe secret of their success with those who struggle with the same \nsituations they've recovered from. If you believe you can create something \nmore then do it. It shouldn't be a ""i'm right you're wrong debate"" it \nshould be for the people.\ufeff",2015-05-26T21:42:54.000Z,5,shakeology,j8-tSEynkxQ,Shakeology Review - Watch Before You Buy Shakeology Shake,,,

0,TheBryantCabrera,"I think Tony Horton makes BeachBody for me.  His personality and face are \njust so iconic that he is more than just P90X or Shakeology to me.\n\nMy favorite benefit of Shakeology is that it helps curb my cravings.  I \nactually feel full during lunch (when I take it) and it prevents me from \nmunching on snacks.  I used to snack all the time around lunch.  \n\nMy favorite flavor is definitely Chocolate.  It just tastes way better than \nI imagined\u2014and this is coming from someone who used to eat boxes of Godiva \ntruffles every month LOL (ah, I miss making money lol).  I mix it with PB2 \nto make a Reese\u2019s flavored shake\u2014my all-time favorite combination.\n\nThe most important benefits to me are:\n1. Price: At only $4 a serving it is cheaper than eating out.  I used to \neat out A LOT as a Yelp Elite member.\n2. Curbs Cravings: I no longer get tempted to snack and go over my calorie \nlimits.  I didn\u2019t actually think Shakeology could help with that, but it \nhas.  I\u2019m not questioning it anymore haha.\n3. Palatability: The chocolate Shakeology just tastes so darn good.  I am \nnot even lying or exaggerating.  I used to review decent restaurants in \nKoreatown and Beverly Hills of Los Angeles, and can be fairly critical of \nfood.  I actually can\u2019t wait to have my Chocolate Shakeology again.\n\nwww.Shakeology.com/BryantCabrera\nwww.BeachBodyCoach.com/BryantCabrera\ufeff",2015-06-18T03:20:19.000Z,7,shakeology,HwgaeGBvm4c,Shakeology Ingredients: Tony Horton Checks Out Shakeology,,,

People need to \nrealize this shake isn't being touted by BB or any coach that it's an \nall-in-one ""get slim fast"" no-lifestyle-change kind of ""miracle"" \nweight-loss cure.  It's a shame because there are MANY MANY people out \nthere, including myself, that are simply customers and love how Shakeology \nhelps with their weight-loss/fitness journeys.  This shake is meant to be \npaired with exercise.  I'll put it to you in the simplest terms I know:  \nThrough its whole/super food contents, Shakeology is designed to help \nAMPLIFY your fitness results.  Take the shake while in a workout regimen, \nand you'll see that you lose THAT MUCH MORE weight, or that you gained THAT \nMUCH MORE muscle definition, or that you've achieved THAT MUCH MORE \nendurance.

When I looked at the \ningredients, the shake it packed with vitamins, some protein and the \nequivalent to actual fruits and veggies is priceless. Beachbody sent her \nthe chocolate sample and she said it tastes like a healthy milkshake. I \nthink people are turned off because of the price but we live in NYC and a \nsalad is like $10. Just think, $10 dollars for only a salad and the shake \nis equivalent to $4 a day. Plus, I cannot imagine my girlfriend eating that \nmany fruits and veggies in a day without throwing up. I think Im gonna try \nit and probably get Vanilla since Im not a chocolate person. Bottomline, I \nthink the shake is great but if people took time to look at the \ningredients, they would see its not a protein shake. The shake is mean't to \nreplace a meal.

0,Richard Carmona,"SENSACIONAL...!!! Soy de Per\xfa y en mi pa\xeds tambi\xe9n hay gente estafada m\xe1s \nque por las Empresas Aludidas, por la ignorancia del promedio de personas. \nCiertamente algunas de las Empresas mencionadas tienen denuncias y podemos \nhasta dudar de la calidad y veracidad de sus Productos... Pero acaso en la \nIndustria tradicional no ocurre lo mismo? Cu\xe1ntas veces has sido \nenga\xf1ado(a) por Productos o Servicios de la Industria Tradicional. \nHay muchos intereses de por medio y este programa dedicado a las MLM con \ntoda la payasada que han expuesto ciertamente tiene algo de verdad: LA \nIMPERIOSA NECESIDAD DE ALGUNOS DISTRIBUIDORES por ""vender o mover \nproductos"" y de otros que fracasaron en el intento y que adem\xe1s fueron \nenga\xf1ados m\xe1s que por las Empresas, por las personas que les invitaron al \nNegocio.\nEn el Multinivel hay De todo como entre las personas que han tenido a bien \nopinar... GENTE CON EDUCACION como GENTE QUE DUDAMOS LA TENGA... Ser\xeda poco \nacertado ""METER A TODOS EN UN SOLO SACO""\nObvio que algunos reaccionan de mala manera porque ven afectados sus \nintereses pero hacerlo de la manera que lo hacen, solo revela su poco \nPROFESIONALISMO en el tema.\nSoy Distribuidor de una Empresa de Redes de Mercadeo Legal con productos de \nalta calidad pero precio justo, especialmente para Latinoam\xe9rica. Desde \n2008 fui probando varias Empresas como Consumidor \xfanicamente pero al notar \nque NO HAB\xcdA RESULTADOS EVIDENTES, deje esos productos para probar con \notros. El resultado? Note la exageraci\xf3n en los resultados de los productos \ny las ganancias que muchos Distribuidores expon\xedan como testimonio... Un \npoco dudoso por cierto. Le\xed mucho, me eduque mucho al respecto y me d\xed \ncuenta de una cosa importante: ""EL MLM NO ES PERFECTO, PERO ES MEJOR"" sin \nninguna duda as\xed como LA BIBLIA es el mejor camino de Vida... Pero ambos \nejemplos, el problema son LOS MENSAJEROS que usan mal ambos MODELOS.\nDesde 2013 tuve el buen tino de elegir una Compa\xf1\xeda de Redes de Mercadeo \nLegal, \xc9tica, Sustentable con productos de ALTO RECONSUMO DIARIO, Todos los \nmeses desde entonces, ingresa dinero a mi cuenta por AYUDAR A LAS PERSONAS \na generarse un ingreso extra real, reemplazando productos QUE YA CONSUMEN, \npor los que distribuye la Compa\xf1\xeda con la que trabajo y algunas de las \npersonas que invite al Negocio desarrollaron un gran Liderazgo por lo que \njuntos nos dedicamos a EDUCAR Personas para que entren a este Negocio por \nla RAZ\xd3N Y NO POR LA EMOCI\xd3N. Sabemos que NO ENGA\xd1AMOS A NADIE y las \npersonas de nuestra Organizaci\xf3n lo valoran...! \nOsea jam\xe1s podr\xedamos ESTAR EN ESTE SEGMENTO DE PERSONAS QUE HOY HAN SIDO \nRIDICULIZADAS POR ESTOS SE\xd1ORES ASALARIADOS QUE IGUAL QUE LOS MALOS \nDISTRIBUIDORES, SOLO HAN DICHO VERDADES A MEDIAS... ASUMIMOS QUE QUIEN \nTENGA UN POCO DE CRITERIO, ENTENDER\xc1 QUE ESTOS SE\xd1ORES VIVEN DE ESO Y QUE \nPOR ESO LO HACEN Y CADA QUIEN SACARA SU PROPIA CONCLUSI\xd3N.\nA quien desee entrar al Mundo de las MLM y desee m\xe1s informaci\xf3n, con gusto \ny sin ning\xfan inter\xe9s podemos facilitarle Informaci\xf3n para que SU DECISI\xd3N \nsea la m\xe1s correcta.

And those of you who \ndismiss a product or a company because of the way they choose to bring \ntheir products to market should probably rethink that mind set. Companies \nlike Herbalife and Youngevity and MANY others are helping people understand \nthat if you give your body the vitamins, minerals, amino acids and the \nessential fatty acids it needs to THRIVE not just survive, you will be \nhealthier, stronger and all the systems of your body will function better. \nHence you will be less prone to illnesses and disease. The human body was \ndesigned with the ablity to heal istelf - as long as you 1) don't poison \nit, and, 2) give it the nuetients it needs to function optimally. \nI heard on the news recently that now 50% of Americans will have some form \nof cancer in their lifetime. If your young you may just accept that or \nthink... well I'll deal with that when the time comes. Well, when that time \ncomes you'd better hope these companies and others like them are still \naround. Otherwise your only option is going to be to go see a doctor who \nwill perscribe some drugs designed tol mask or manage the symptoms you \nhave. Our ""health-care"" system isn't treating or even looking for the ""root \ncause"" of patient's problems. In other words they are not interested in \ncuring you and I don't see that changing anytime soon. If you are young \nyou'd be wise to start learing about nutrition now and start learning not \nto eat with your eyes. Learn and train yourself to eat with your brain, and \nnot your eyes. We, Americans, are killing ourselves out of ignorace about \nwhat and how to eat, what food has nutricianal value and which ""FOODS"" \ndon't and our children are suffering BIG TIME because of it. \nJust becuse a peice of video was produced and aired by ABC, NBC, etc \ndoesn't mean its correct. Likewise just becuase product is distributed by a \ncompany like Youngevity, or Herbalife instead of Walmart or Amazon, doesn't \nmean it's not good - it doesn't mean that it is either. So, YOU are going \nto have to learn to determin what's good and what's not good for yourself. \nDon't realy on your government (FDA) to do it for you, AND it's not their \nplace to regulate the industry for you either. We probaly wouldn't trust it \nif they did. Food lables have helped a lot but you still have to have some \nbasic knowledge that we should be teaching in schools and maybe some \nschools are starting too. I hope so. It's kind of important stuff. \nI will say though that the cultures of some of those MLM companies makes \ntheir motivation for selling these kinds of products suspect. Many of the \ndistributs do make false or imbelished claims so It's definately ""buyer \nbeware"" and that's all the more reason to get educted. You really can help \nyour body Thrive and become less prone to a bunch of diseases. Live Longer, \nStronger and Wiser.

0,Latin Fire,"Congrats on your weight loss. I really love the concept of a truly plant \nbased vegan diet. It is so good for the body, good for the environment and \nsomething I am currently striving for. I would just like to say, I think \nyou looked beautiful before, just as you look beautiful after. I think that \nthe concept of losing weight for health and for beauty need to be \nseparated. We must be inclusive of all body types and people because \nhonestly, you really didnt look ""fat"" before. Watching you call yourself \ndisgusting I think is hurtful to yourself as well as anyone else watching \nthat may be that size or perhaps even larger. Also, the correlation between \n""size zero and perfect"" is also in my opinion, misleading. If you are happy \nwhere you are, that is perfect. I hope no one perceives a size six, or size \n16 for that matter as imperfect. A person of any size is valuable, \nbeautiful, and perfect the way they are. If they choose to be healthy and \nloose weight, that awesome, but they are certainly not disgusting for being \nwhat society deems as overweight. I love everything else and dont mean to \ncriticize, but as a plus size woman, just recently joining the quest to \nloose weight in a healthy, plant based way, I feel it is important that \nwomen accept and love themselves no matter what. I love my body and am not \nashamed of it. I merely want to extend my health and longevity as much as \npossible and feel more energetic during my life.

0,Randy Larson,"Good for you I'm very proud of you and I know the commitment it takes to \nlose the weight! !\nWhen I finally got fed up looking the way I did I've lost 132 pounds in 18 \nmonths. It's the first time I've made an attempt to lose the weight the \nright way instead of Nutra Systems, Dr Bernstein or some other fad diet. \nBelieve me I lost the weight on these programs. Biggest loss was my last \none on Dr Bernstein 80 pounds 4 months.\nProblem is I gained it all back and then some as soon as I started eating \nnormal food.\nWhen I decided to lose weight this time all I did was the simplest thing \nquit pop and junk food!! Very important to get off that shit!! At supper \nrather than fill up a dinner plate I used the next size of plate down!! I \ncontinued this at each of my meals.\nI still ate what everybody else ate.\nWhen I was finished and if I was still hungry I waited 20 minutes from when \nI finished eating and if I was still hungry I would have a little more. \nHonestly I rarely had more because i was comfortable.\nIf there was dessert like pie which I love I would just take half of \nwhatever I used to. \nNever once stopped me from losing weight that week.\nI stuck to this simple plan for a year. I chose to quit salt and drink 6 to \n8 bottles 500 ml water a day \nIve kept the weight off for over a year and I feel a heck of a lot better \nand people look at me differently which is always good.\nplease remember I did this for me no else. I wanted to do what ever I could \nsee my kids grow up and their kids.\nAfter 3 months of no salt I went to Wendy's and got a classic single \nburger. I was so looking forward go that burger and it was a treat for me.\nMy mouth was watering and I took a bite and was shocked at the amount of \nsalt in that burger.\nIt was like someone had put the whole thing of salt in that burger.\nWell its been almost two years and I've never ordered a fast food burger \nsince.\nIt's all about COMMITMENT and DETERMINATION which you seem to have both.\nCongratulations on your significant weight loss you should be very proud of \nyourself!!\ufeff",2016-11-10T03:47:43.000Z,0,310 shake,rvkhpdKq-vk,Before & After VIDEO Of My 55+ Pound Weight Loss,,,

0,Asmr Ksenia,"24 shakes cost $42 but each $25 tub serves 16. Plus GNC always has them on \nBOGO 50% off sales. So with that sale you'd get 32 servings for $37 approx. \nWithout the sale you get 32 servings for $50. That's 8 more servings than \nthe bottles for $8 more. If you buy the on the go version 8 servings cost \n$14. So, you definitly get a better deal buying the tubs than the bottles. \nPlus, I usually get 20 servings per tub give or take one. :)\ufeff",2015-04-21T22:04:43.000Z,0,GNC total lean shake,371R0q0dWvM,Weight Loss Journey: GNC Total Lean Shake Review!

I'm also a BB Coach \nand have been drinking Shakeology daily for almost 3 years and when one of \nmy coaches asked me about this product I did my own review as well. I went \nto Walmart, a store I normally don't support, like you, and bought this. \nYour review states that OmniHealth's second ingredient is Fructose... So is \nShakeology's! Shakeology lists their proprietary superfoods separately from \nits ""other ingredients"" but the first ""other ingredient"" in Shakeology is \nin fact Fructose. Also, you talk about the ""fair value"" of Shakeology \ncompared to OmniHealth but what you fail to mention us that Shakeology is a \nMLM product. When a coach sells it, they get $32, not to mention the up \nline dollar amounts being given to the coach's coach. When you take away \nthe MLM value of Shakeology, it actually comes out to just about the \nidentical cost of OmniHealth.\nYou're an unethical coach doing a review on a product to keep your pockets \nlined.\ufeff",2016-07-04T15:59:39.000Z,1,omnihealth meal replacement,uE0J_oXh4u8,Is OmniHealth comparable to Shakeology?,,,

You bring out the fact that crystalline fructose is listed \nafter the protein blend, and that equates to more sugar in it yet they both \nlist 7g?

0,Latin Fire,"Congrats on your weight loss. I really love the concept of a truly plant \nbased vegan diet. It is so good for the body, good for the environment and \nsomething I am currently striving for. I would just like to say, I think \nyou looked beautiful before, just as you look beautiful after. I think that \nthe concept of losing weight for health and for beauty need to be \nseparated. We must be inclusive of all body types and people because \nhonestly, you really didnt look ""fat"" before. Watching you call yourself \ndisgusting I think is hurtful to yourself as well as anyone else watching \nthat may be that size or perhaps even larger. Also, the correlation between \n""size zero and perfect"" is also in my opinion, misleading. If you are happy \nwhere you are, that is perfect. I hope no one perceives a size six, or size \n16 for that matter as imperfect. A person of any size is valuable, \nbeautiful, and perfect the way they are. If they choose to be healthy and \nloose weight, that awesome, but they are certainly not disgusting for being \nwhat society deems as overweight. I love everything else and dont mean to \ncriticize, but as a plus size woman, just recently joining the quest to \nloose weight in a healthy, plant based way, I feel it is important that \nwomen accept and love themselves no matter what. I love my body and am not \nashamed of it. I merely want to extend my health and longevity as much as \npossible and feel more energetic during my life.

0,Randy Larson,"Good for you I'm very proud of you and I know the commitment it takes to \nlose the weight! !\nWhen I finally got fed up looking the way I did I've lost 132 pounds in 18 \nmonths. It's the first time I've made an attempt to lose the weight the \nright way instead of Nutra Systems, Dr Bernstein or some other fad diet. \nBelieve me I lost the weight on these programs. Biggest loss was my last \none on Dr Bernstein 80 pounds 4 months.\nProblem is I gained it all back and then some as soon as I started eating \nnormal food.\nWhen I decided to lose weight this time all I did was the simplest thing \nquit pop and junk food!! Very important to get off that shit!! At supper \nrather than fill up a dinner plate I used the next size of plate down!! I \ncontinued this at each of my meals.\nI still ate what everybody else ate.\nWhen I was finished and if I was still hungry I waited 20 minutes from when \nI finished eating and if I was still hungry I would have a little more. \nHonestly I rarely had more because i was comfortable.\nIf there was dessert like pie which I love I would just take half of \nwhatever I used to. \nNever once stopped me from losing weight that week.\nI stuck to this simple plan for a year. I chose to quit salt and drink 6 to \n8 bottles 500 ml water a day \nIve kept the weight off for over a year and I feel a heck of a lot better \nand people look at me differently which is always good.\nplease remember I did this for me no else. I wanted to do what ever I could \nsee my kids grow up and their kids.\nAfter 3 months of no salt I went to Wendy's and got a classic single \nburger. I was so looking forward go that burger and it was a treat for me.\nMy mouth was watering and I took a bite and was shocked at the amount of \nsalt in that burger.\nIt was like someone had put the whole thing of salt in that burger.\nWell its been almost two years and I've never ordered a fast food burger \nsince.\nIt's all about COMMITMENT and DETERMINATION which you seem to have both.\nCongratulations on your significant weight loss you should be very proud of \nyourself!!\ufeff",2016-11-10T03:47:43.000Z,0,omnihealth meal replacement,rvkhpdKq-vk,Before & After VIDEO Of My 55+ Pound Weight Loss,,,

0,John Smith,"Good food, video, Doctor Dave. People making shakes at home can see how to \nperk up the pizzazz, to a cold shake for the folks on a diet. I use the \nAspartame found in Equate from Walmart, to sweeten my coffee.\n\nI use to use canned milk in my coffee, but your friend the HOSS IT IS had a \nvideo about Gossner boxed milk, available at the Dollar-Tree for $1 a \nquart. The Walmart down the road, had the Gossner milk for something like \n$2++ for a while.\n\nGossner milk can be stored on a kitchen shelf, with an expiration date of 1 \nyear later, typically. The milk is packaged with different fat contents. \nThe milk doesn't need refrigeration until the package is opened.\n\n\nDollar Tree has a program, where someone can order a case of 12 quarters, \nand then pick them up at the Dollar Tree Store. The Gossner milk is made in \nthe USA. Dollar Tree stores sell a lot of things made in China, even some \nof the ~food items. \n\nI looked online; there's a Dollar Tree in Crossville TN. Your Dollar Tree \nmight NOT carry the milk in the store inventory, but it can be ordered and \nshipped to the store, for you. (This is assuming Doctor Dave is drinking \nmilk, in his coffee. I didn't see a goat milk producer in the new videos.)\ufeff",2016-11-12T21:23:45.000Z,1,bariatric advantage meal replacement,LYIVFULwRjs,Bariatric Advantage Shakes Made Better,,,
